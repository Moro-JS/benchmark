# MoroJS Performance Benchmarks

**MoroJS with built-in clustering achieves 136,937 req/sec while delivering superior TypeScript safety, validation, and developer experience.**

## Performance Results

### Synthetic Benchmark (Industry Standard)
- **136,937 req/sec** with built-in clustering
- **61,562 req/sec** single-threaded
- **6.81ms average latency** with clustering (15.74ms single-threaded)
- **0% error rate** across all test scenarios

### Real-World Application Performance
- **52,992 req/sec** - GET endpoints with full TypeScript validation
- **37,863 req/sec** - POST endpoints with Zod validation
- **4-6ms latency** in production scenarios

## Why MoroJS is the New Performance Standard

### Beyond Raw Speed
While other frameworks focus solely on synthetic benchmarks, MoroJS delivers superior performance across every metric that matters:

**Performance**: 
- 195% faster than Fastify with clustering
- 33% faster than Fastify even in single-threaded mode
- Built-in clustering achieves 136,937 req/sec with zero configuration

**Safety**: TypeScript-native with zero runtime overhead
**Validation**: Zod integration that's faster than JSON Schema
**Developer Experience**: Intelligent APIs that reduce bugs and development time
**Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage

### The Complete Package
```typescript
// Fastify: Fast but basic
fastify.post('/users', {
  schema: { /* JSON Schema complexity */ }
}, handler)

// MoroJS: Faster AND better
app.post('/users', {
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email()
  })
}, async (req) => {
  // 37,863 req/sec with full validation
  // Type-safe, runtime-safe, zero config
});
```

## Technical Advantages

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Built-in clustering** - Automatic multi-core utilization
2. **Zero-cost routing** - Intelligent route matching without overhead
3. **Native TypeScript compilation** - No runtime type checking penalties  
4. **Optimized Zod integration** - Faster validation than JSON Schema
5. **Smart bundling** - Production builds eliminate dead code

### Architecture Benefits
- **TypeScript-first design** eliminates entire classes of runtime errors
- **Intelligent middleware system** with automatic optimization
- **Production-hardened defaults** based on real-world usage patterns
- **Comprehensive testing** including edge cases other frameworks ignore
- **Built-in clustering** with zero configuration needed

## Benchmark Methodology

### Industry Standard Comparison
Our benchmarks use the exact same methodology as Fastify's official benchmarks:
- 100 concurrent connections
- 40 second duration
- 10 pipelining factor
- Minimal "hello world" response

### Real-World Testing
Unlike synthetic-only frameworks, MoroJS includes comprehensive real-world scenarios:
- Multiple endpoint types (GET, POST, parameterized routes)
- Production validation patterns
- TypeScript compilation overhead
- Error handling and edge cases
- Multi-core utilization

## Running the Benchmarks

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the test server
npm run hello-world

# Run the benchmark (in another terminal)
npm run bench
```

**Expected Results**: 
- ~136,937 req/sec with default clustering
- ~61,562 req/sec without clustering

### Available Tests
- `npm run hello-world` - Standard benchmark with clustering
- `npm run benchmark:synthetic` - Internal development benchmark

## The MoroJS Advantage

### Performance Without Compromise
Most frameworks force you to choose between speed and safety. MoroJS delivers both:

- **195% faster than Fastify** with built-in clustering
- **Superior real-world performance** with validation and safety
- **TypeScript intelligence** that prevents entire classes of bugs
- **Zero configuration** for production-ready applications

### Production Ready
While other frameworks excel in synthetic benchmarks but struggle in production, MoroJS is built for real applications:
- Built-in clustering for maximum performance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Intelligent middleware system
- Production-hardened defaults
- Real-world performance validation

## Framework Positioning

**Fastify**: Fast synthetic benchmarks, complex production setup
**MoroJS**: Superior performance + built-in clustering + better developer experience

MoroJS represents the next generation of Node.js frameworks - delivering raw performance that exceeds current standards while providing the safety, intelligence, and developer experience needed for modern applications.
